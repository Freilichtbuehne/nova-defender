However, these messages can be easily manipulated by a client.
So if the server does not check if the client is allowed to send this message at all,
exploitable security holes (money glitch, server crashes, admin rights) can occur.

All listed names of netmessages can or could be exploited.
There is no guarantee that this vulnerability still exists.
Also there can be vulnerable netmessages which are not listed here.

   3. A developer with access to your server has built a backdoor for himself
   4. The server itself has been compromised (vulnerability in the operating system,
      vulnerability in software)

Ways to remove a back door:
   1. If available, check given path (if path starts with 'lua/' it's likely from workshop)
   2. Scan your server with e.g. https://github.com/THABBuzzkill/nomalua
   3. Remove all scripts you added recently and check if this message appears again
   4. Download all files on your server and do a text search for the listed backdoor
   5. HARD WAY: remove ALL addons until this message stops appearing, then add them
